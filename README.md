# CyberEase 🛡️

In this project, I was tasked with developing a modern, responsive website for a cybersecurity startup.

CyberEase is a cybersecurity consulting startup focused on simplifying digital protection for individuals and small-to-mid-sized businesses. The site offers tailored solutions to help safeguard against common cyber threats such as scams, data breaches, and phishing attacks. CyberEase offers vulnerability scannig, phishing attacks, and GRC audits. 

This project was created to showcase front-end web development skills — including layout design, responsive UI, and accessibility — while presenting cybersecurity services in a clean, professional, and easy-to-navigate format.
